# Advanced SwiftUI Demo

## Setup
The app is using the **Unsplash API** to fetch random photos for display.
In order to run the app yourself you will have to create demo creadentials to access the API.

1. Go to [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers), register yourself and create a `Demo` app to get your authentication credentials.
2. Open the `UnsplashAuth.swift` file.
3. Replace `UnsplashAuth.applicationID`, `UnsplashAuth.accessKey` and  `UnsplashAuth.secretKey` with your own access credentials.
